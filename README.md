# CharmSimulator
### Overview
CharmSimulator is a state-of-the-art simulation tool designed for creating and simulating tunnel mining environments. With a rich set of features, it allows users to craft procedural tunnel landscapes and to embed vehicle and sensor simulations within them. Simulator is developed under the [CHARM ECSEL JU](https://charm-ecsel.eu/) project that develops ECS (Electronics, Components & Systems) predictive maintenance, automation, condition monitoring, real-time production control and its optimization, virtual prototype systems and their testing in real industrial conditions.

### Purpose
The primary goal of CharmSimulator is to demonstrate the versatility of modern game engines, specifically Unreal Engine 5, in emulating various tunnel environments. It not only showcases the potential of the engine but also provides a robust foundation for further enhancements. At its core, CharmSimulator boasts a procedural runtime mesh generator, allowing developers to modify and adapt it according to specific requirements.
